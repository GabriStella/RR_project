# 1 Introduction

*Card and Krueger research* at least 30/35 rows. 

## 1_1 Data Summarize {.tabset}

### 1_1_1 Card and Krueger's Data. 

```{r, echo = F}

kable(head(dt, 15), booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 11)

```

### 1_1_2 Our implementation.  
```{r, echo = F}
kable(head(dt [16:18, 1:14]), booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 11)

```

### 1_1_3 Meta analysis Data Frame 

```{r, echo = F}
kable(head(dt, 18), booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 11)

```

## 1_2 Variable

as we can see they used a set of 15 studies and we went to implement with three studies most recent. 

the variable that they use was 12: 

- consists of the author(s), 
- date of publication (year), 
- t-statistic in absolute terms1 (t_stat), 
- degrees of freedom (df), 
- coefficient of the minimum wage variable in absolute terms2 (coef), 
- number of explanatory variables of the model (no_exp_var), 
- the error of the model (error) `[also log and sqrt_log of error.]`
- and three dummy varibale: 
  - log_spec
    - this variable is set to 1 when the author used a logarithmic specification for the model
  - autoreg_correction
    - this is set to 1, when the autoregression correction was applied
  - teen_subsample
    - this variable is set to one when the authors used a teen sumbsample, unfortunatly we didn't find enough information to fill the missing data. 
  

  
# 2 Reproducing Part

the authors implemented this study focusing on three cases: 

## 2_1 Relation of Estimated t-Ratio to Sample Size 
```{r, echo = F, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
fig_1_old
```

## 2_2 Descreptive Regression Models

## 2_3 Relation of Estimated Employment to Standard Error

```{r, echo = F}
fig_2_old
```

# 3 Implementation 

Our assignment doesn't concern just the reproducing part, but now we want to implement the same study implemented with our data. 

## 3_1 Relation of Estimated t-Ratio to Sample Size- Implemented

```{r, echo = F, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
fig_1_new
```

## 3_2 Descreptive Regression Models- Implemented
<img src="data/tbl 2.png"/>

## 3_3 Relation of Estimated Employment to Standard Error- Implemented

```{r, echo = F, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
fig_2_new
```
